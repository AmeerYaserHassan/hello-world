# hello-world
This is a practice repository for me to learn how GitHub works.

It's telling me to write a bit about myself now. Not really sure what to put here.
I think I'm just going to keep this repository here for when I'm a huge programmer hacker man.
I can look back at this and say wow, this guy didn't even know how to use GitHub.

Maybe.
